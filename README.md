![pexels-lukas-669619](https://github.com/nwyGit/DVD-database-project/assets/105307947/d64aa98a-9ba6-4f76-bc67-76ada82718e2)

This SQL project involves working with the DVD Rental sample database in PostgreSQL. The database contains various tables related to actors, films, categories, stores, rentals, payments, staff, customers, addresses, cities, and countries.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will be exploring the DVD Rental database and performing various SQL queries to retrieve useful information from the tables. The queries will involve data retrieval, filtering, aggregation, and joining multiple tables to gain insights from the database.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed on your local machine.
2. Download the DVD Rental sample database from [here](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/).
3. Load the sample database into your PostgreSQL server.
4. Connect to the database using your preferred SQL client.

## Queries and Analysis

This section will include the 10 queries we will perform on the DVD Rental database. Each query will have a brief description of its purpose.

1. Query 1: Retrieve customers, ID, name, email, and the total number of rentals made.
2. Query 2: Retrieve rental statistics for films in different countries and categories.
3. Query 3: Calculate the average and total prices for each film category.
4. Query 4: Retrieves a list of films available in the inventory that have never been rented.
5. Query 5: Find the top 10 actors who have appeared in the most films.
6. Query 6: List the top 5 staff members who processed the most rentals.
7. Query 7: Determine the average length of films in each category.
8. Query 8: Identify the top 5 customers who have made most value of rentals.
9. Query 9: Categorize films by length.
10. Query 10: Categorize customers by rental frequency.
